// This is a test where an entire hand is played.
// I
// Here I apply a different testing strategy
//
// First I create one connection with the server per player.
// Then I create different streams to represent different phases of a game
// and insert into them the assertions specific to that phase. The streams are
// - the players enter the Osteria
// - the players receive the notification that they have actually entered the Osteria
// - a new game is created
// - the players join the game
// - a new hand is started
// - cards are played by each player
// - final score is received at the end of the hand
//
// There is also another stream which receives all messages received from the server
// and collect them in a set of arrays, one array per player
//
// All these streams are eventually merged and subscriebd
